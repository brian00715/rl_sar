/**
 * @brief rl_sar's end of the ZeroMQ link to the OCS2 MPC bridge.
 *
 * Publishes robot state and receives whole-body commands. Both sockets are
 * CONFLATE=1: a real-time controller only ever wants the newest frame, and a
 * queue that grows under load is worse than a dropped sample.
 *
 * Threading: Start() spawns one receiver thread that owns the SUB socket.
 * PublishState() owns the PUB socket and must be called from a single thread
 * (rl_sar's loop_bridge); GetCommand() is safe from any thread.
 *
 * The link is treated as unreliable by construction. GetCommand() reports the
 * age of the newest sample and Link() classifies it, so callers never have to
 * reason about wall-clock timeouts themselves.
