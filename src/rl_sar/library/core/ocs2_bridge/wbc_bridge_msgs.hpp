/*
 * Wire protocol between the OCS2 MPC bridge and rl_sar.
 *
 * DUPLICATE COPY. The canonical file lives at
 *   go2_x5_ocs2_bridge/include/wbc_bridge/wbc_bridge_msgs.hpp
 * and is duplicated here so that rl_sar stays buildable without the ROS 2
 * workspace on the include path. Edit both, and bump kProtocolVersion on every
 * layout change -- receivers reject foreign versions rather than reinterpreting bytes.
 *
 * Transport: ZeroMQ, one PUB/SUB socket per direction, both ends CONFLATE=1 so
 * only the newest frame is ever delivered. Payload is the raw struct; sender and
 * receiver are the same host and ABI, so no serialisation library is involved.
 *
 * Clocks: every `stamp` is std::chrono::steady_clock seconds. On Linux that is
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC, which is system-wide, so stamps from the two processes are
 * directly comparable and (recv_now - msg.stamp) is a true one-way latency.
 * Staleness must still be judged with the receiver's own clock at receive time.
